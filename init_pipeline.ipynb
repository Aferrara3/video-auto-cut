      "[00:52.720 --> 00:53.720]  Okay.\n",
      "[00:53.720 --> 00:56.800]  So can you talk a little bit about sunrise of Alexandria,\n",
      "[00:56.920 --> 01:00.920]  what stood out to you, what you noticed about this community?\n",
      "[01:02.160 --> 01:05.120]  Well, as I've told almost anybody that I've met\n",
      "[01:05.120 --> 01:08.560]  who's coming in here and I try to encourage them,\n",
      "[01:08.560 --> 01:13.080]  I think this is a wonderful place for people to come to live.\n",
      "[01:13.080 --> 01:18.080]  Sunrise embodies a lot of things that everyone wants,\n",
      "[01:19.480 --> 01:24.480]  security, kindness, happiness, a happy face,\n",
      "[01:25.480 --> 01:30.480]  good food, a good bed, and people who care about what's happening to you.\n",
      "[01:32.040 --> 01:36.560]  So that's what I find as sunrise and I haven't been disappointed.\n",
      "[01:38.240 --> 01:42.560]  As you may not know, I came here on what we call,\n",
      "[01:42.560 --> 01:47.560]  I call a respite stay for one month in the first place without intending to stay.\n",

      "[01:59.840 --> 02:05.120]  So she and her husband took a little vacation and I came in here for a month\n",
      "[02:05.120 --> 02:09.920]  just to have a place to stay so they wouldn't have to worry about me,\n",
      "[02:09.920 --> 02:12.800]  not thinking that I would ever want to come and stay.\n",
      "[02:14.160 --> 02:17.520]  However, that month was pleasant.\n",
      "[02:17.520 --> 02:26.320]  I didn't feel very sad about any changes.\n",
      "[02:26.320 --> 02:28.320]  I felt comfortable in every way.\n",
      "[02:28.320 --> 02:33.200]  And so my son-in-law is just delighted that he had that idea\n",
      "[02:33.200 --> 02:37.120]  that I should come here and try it out because then I decided,\n",
      "[02:37.120 --> 02:38.560]  yes, this is where I like to be.\n",
      "[02:38.560 --> 02:41.280]  Wow, that's awesome.\n",
      "[02:41.280 --> 02:44.080]  Well, we're some of the things that you enjoy so much.\n",
      "[02:44.080 --> 02:46.240]  I'm Baker Parnett.\n",
      "[02:46.240 --> 02:50.000]  But what were some of the things or activities or what part of the community\n",
      "[02:50.000 --> 02:51.440]  is what made you want to stay?\n",
      "[02:54.000 --> 03:01.520]  I think one of the things that I enjoy and it was one of my requisites,\n",
      "[03:01.520 --> 03:03.440]  I'm a very independent person.\n",
      "[03:03.440 --> 03:05.280]  I've lived alone most of my life,\n",
      "[03:05.280 --> 03:08.640]  including during my marriage, I was more alone than I was married.\n",
      "[03:09.440 --> 03:11.040]  I like it.\n",
      "[03:11.920 --> 03:15.120]  So I was guaranteed by Aaron,\n",
      "[03:15.120 --> 03:19.600]  bless or heart, that I would not be intruded upon if I didn't want it.\n",
      "[03:20.560 --> 03:25.600]  So I have been given my security and my independence,\n",
      "[03:26.320 --> 03:28.160]  and when I need help, it's here.\n",
      "[03:29.040 --> 03:33.760]  And if there's something I don't want to do, I don't have to do it.\n",
      "[03:33.760 --> 03:36.400]  If there's something I do want to do, I do it.\n",
      "[03:38.560 --> 03:39.600]  That's great.\n",
      "[03:39.600 --> 03:42.480]  What do you participate in any of the activities?\n",
      "[03:43.440 --> 03:44.240]  Excuse me.\n",
      "[03:44.240 --> 03:46.320]  Do you participate in any of the activities?\n",
      "[03:46.320 --> 03:48.080]  Oh, yes I do.\n",
      "[03:48.080 --> 03:48.720]  Yes I do.\n",
      "[03:49.440 --> 03:50.720]  There's a book club here.\n",
      "[03:50.720 --> 03:52.080]  I'm a great reader.\n",
      "[03:52.080 --> 03:53.040]  I'm not a great reader.\n",
      "[03:53.040 --> 03:54.000]  I like to read.\n",
      "[03:54.960 --> 04:00.320]  And now that I'm having all the vision issues that I'm having,\n",
      "[04:00.320 --> 04:02.160]  I use Audible for my books.\n",
      "[04:02.800 --> 04:07.760]  So I'm frequently way ahead of everybody else who's reading the way I prefer to read\n",
      "[04:07.760 --> 04:08.800]  with a book in my hand.\n",
      "[04:09.600 --> 04:11.040]  So I enjoy the book club.\n",
      "[04:11.840 --> 04:17.440]  Every afternoon they have a wonderful social event here around three o'clock\n",
      "[04:17.440 --> 04:23.360]  where they give you some more food and some socialization with one another\n",
      "[04:23.360 --> 04:26.880]  where you can get to know who your neighbors are, which is wonderful.\n",
      "[04:27.520 --> 04:31.600]  And everybody here has a great story to tell if you're listening.\n",
      "[04:32.480 --> 04:35.280]  And I also go to Bible study.\n",
      "[04:36.240 --> 04:40.480]  And I have gone, they have outings once a week.\n",
      "[04:41.840 --> 04:47.200]  Our wonderful activities director Kendall takes the bus and takes us all on a little\n",
      "[04:47.200 --> 04:49.680]  trip someplace to the library.\n",
      "[04:49.680 --> 04:55.120]  They went to the museum this past week in DC, natural history museum.\n",
      "[04:55.120 --> 05:00.960]  I have been on one of those trips and that's also great because you can get out.\n",
      "[05:01.440 --> 05:06.160]  And some, I'm not a bingo player.\n",
      "[05:06.160 --> 05:09.920]  They play a lot of bingo here so I can't say that I enjoy the bingo.\n",
      "[05:09.920 --> 05:11.600]  A lot of it has to do with my vision.\n",
      "[05:11.600 --> 05:14.400]  I cannot see those little numbers on the cards.\n",
      "[05:14.400 --> 05:16.160]  And everybody says, oh, they'll help me.\n",
      "[05:16.160 --> 05:16.720]  They'll help me.\n",
      "[05:16.720 --> 05:19.520]  But that's my independent speaking up again.\n",
      "[05:21.120 --> 05:21.760]  That's great.\n",
      "[05:22.480 --> 05:29.200]  What are some of the ways that the team here helps you stay independent or live your best life?\n",
      "[05:31.040 --> 05:34.160]  What helps me stay here and be independent?\n",
      "[05:36.080 --> 05:42.880]  I think some of the things I've already mentioned to stay independent,\n",
      "[05:44.000 --> 05:46.160]  you know, I take care totally of myself.\n",
      "[05:46.160 --> 05:50.640]  I've been told that I am the only one here who handles their own medications.\n",
      "[05:52.400 --> 05:54.240]  I'm capable so why would I not?\n",
      "[05:55.120 --> 05:59.200]  And I don't really need help with much of anything.\n",
      "[05:59.200 --> 06:01.600]  I don't, yes, I do.\n",
      "[06:01.600 --> 06:03.120]  I don't hear well.\n",
      "[06:03.120 --> 06:04.160]  I don't see well.\n",
      "[06:04.960 --> 06:09.760]  I'm still learning a better date than I had before my injury.\n",
      "[06:09.760 --> 06:13.120]  I used to walk five miles a day before this injury happened.\n",
      "[06:14.960 --> 06:17.120]  So I do my exercises here.\n",
      "[06:17.120 --> 06:22.880]  Another thing that I forgot to mention that I get involved in is we have some yoga classes here\n",
      "[06:23.600 --> 06:29.440]  that in the morning, on several days we have yoga classes and then in the afternoon,\n",
      "[06:30.240 --> 06:34.320]  we play another one on TV and watch that and do yoga.\n",
      "[06:34.320 --> 06:37.840]  So exercises, part of, has been part of my life, all my life.\n",
      "[06:37.840 --> 06:38.880]  So that's great.\n",
      "[06:39.680 --> 06:46.160]  And in addition to the exercises that my physical therapist has given me, that adds to it.\n",
      "[06:46.160 --> 06:50.480]  So it adds to your good health, mental and physical.\n",
      "[06:51.280 --> 06:53.360]  No doubt. It's great to stay active.\n",
      "[06:56.080 --> 07:03.840]  At what point when you were living here in that month, did you decide like this place is for me\n",
      "[07:03.840 --> 07:05.280]  that I want to stay here?\n",
      "[07:05.280 --> 07:11.760]  Well, in all actuality, when I came here for that respite once, I had no intention of coming here.\n",
      "[07:11.760 --> 07:15.600]  I mean, I didn't even know that it was being considered by my family, but that was.\n",
      "[07:15.600 --> 07:17.200]  That's what they were considering.\n",
      "[07:18.080 --> 07:19.280]  And I wasn't pushed.\n",
      "[07:20.720 --> 07:22.080]  They didn't encourage me.\n",
      "[07:22.080 --> 07:23.040]  It was what I wanted.\n",
      "[07:23.040 --> 07:24.240]  Do I like it?\n",
      "[07:24.240 --> 07:25.440]  What do I think about it?\n",
      "[07:26.000 --> 07:26.880]  Could I live here?\n",
      "[07:27.680 --> 07:30.960]  Most difficult thing about a move like this, I will tell you.\n",
      "[07:31.520 --> 07:36.400]  And if you have any aging parents or grandparents, they will tell you this very same thing.\n",
      "[07:36.400 --> 07:39.760]  Everybody here will agree with what I'm going to tell you.\n",
      "[07:39.760 --> 07:44.720]  The most difficult thing about coming into a facility, such as sunrise,\n",
      "[07:44.720 --> 07:47.600]  as beautiful as it is, as caring as it is.\n",
      "[07:47.600 --> 07:53.280]  The most difficult thing is leaving some of your possessions because you can't bring everything with you.\n",
      "[07:54.080 --> 07:56.640]  If you had a house, for instance, I didn't.\n",
      "[07:56.640 --> 08:01.440]  I sold my house a long time ago, but I had a big apartment.\n",
      "[08:01.440 --> 08:06.240]  And I had a lot of, I'm one of those crazy people that gets attached to things.\n",
      "[08:06.240 --> 08:08.080]  I got attached to my car.\n",
      "[08:08.080 --> 08:10.160]  I get attached to my furniture.\n",
      "[08:10.160 --> 08:14.240]  So it was very painful to give up things.\n",
      "[08:14.880 --> 08:20.720]  So in that month that you're asking me about, I thought about that.\n",
      "[08:20.720 --> 08:21.520]  What could I bring?\n",
      "[08:21.520 --> 08:23.040]  What could I not bring?\n",
      "[08:23.040 --> 08:28.240]  So by the time that I decided to come here, I had all my furniture placed in my room,\n",
      "[08:28.240 --> 08:32.560]  in my apartment, physically, mentally, physically, visually.\n",
      "[08:32.560 --> 08:36.480]  And it will work just exactly as I planned to work.\n",
      "[08:36.480 --> 08:40.000]  And then there's so many other things when you're making a move like that.\n",
      "[08:40.000 --> 08:42.960]  You have to find all the right people to do these things for you.\n",
      "[08:43.920 --> 08:45.360]  An anticipation of it.\n",
      "[08:45.360 --> 08:47.040]  But that is one of the hardest things.\n",
      "[08:47.040 --> 08:52.800]  And as I say, if you have an aged relative in your family that has to make this move.\n",
      "[08:54.400 --> 08:55.760]  And you know, here's another thing.\n",
      "[08:56.640 --> 09:00.000]  If you have someone like that, they will repeat what I'm telling you.\n",
      "[09:00.000 --> 09:01.520]  That's the hardest part.\n",
      "[09:01.520 --> 09:04.240]  But the other thing that I was going to say is,\n",
      "[09:05.600 --> 09:09.200]  I had a, I was in business for 43 years.\n",
      "[09:09.280 --> 09:14.080]  And I had many customers whose family,\n",
      "[09:15.920 --> 09:19.520]  this is interesting, I think, whose family would\n",
      "[09:19.520 --> 09:23.600]  a son or a daughter like you, like you, Charlie, young person like you,\n",
      "[09:23.600 --> 09:26.960]  who'd fly in from California into Pennsylvania where I lived.\n",
      "[09:27.520 --> 09:29.520]  Because mom needs help.\n",
      "[09:29.520 --> 09:33.120]  Oh, I didn't know mom couldn't get on and off of the commode.\n",
      "[09:33.120 --> 09:35.760]  And they would come in to buy a commode from me.\n",
      "[09:35.760 --> 09:38.000]  Oh, I didn't know mom had this, no.\n",
      "[09:38.080 --> 09:42.640]  And so now they're coming back and forth weekly from California to take care of mom.\n",
      "[09:43.200 --> 09:46.800]  I said to myself, then, I will never do that to my children.\n",
      "[09:46.800 --> 09:48.000]  Never. Well, I do that.\n",
      "[09:48.720 --> 09:54.880]  And so that was another driving force for me to make up my mind that I could relieve the\n",
      "[09:54.880 --> 09:59.440]  whole family of having to take care of mom because I'm taking care of here.\n",
      "[09:59.440 --> 10:03.440]  Now, here's my daughter who I'm telling you is so wonderful and she is.\n",
      "[10:04.080 --> 10:05.920]  Finally took a little trip with her husband.\n",
      "[10:05.920 --> 10:07.680]  They went to Michigan this past week.\n",
      "[10:08.000 --> 10:10.880]  And I said, see, you can go and you don't have to worry about me.\n",
      "[10:10.880 --> 10:12.240]  I'm being taken care of.\n",
      "[10:12.240 --> 10:14.320]  Otherwise, they would have dragged me along.\n",
      "[10:14.320 --> 10:18.880]  They took me on all their vacation all the time.\n",
      "[10:18.880 --> 10:20.080]  And that's not right.\n",
      "[10:20.080 --> 10:21.200]  You know, they're young yet.\n",
      "[10:21.200 --> 10:23.120]  They should have some time to themselves.\n",
      "[10:23.120 --> 10:24.240]  So that's all of it.\n",
      "[10:26.640 --> 10:27.360]  That's funny.\n",

      "[10:34.240 --> 10:36.400]  downsizing is challenging?\n",
      "[10:37.040 --> 10:42.560]  What would you say to someone who's maybe in your shoes or is going to use shoes?\n",
      "[10:42.560 --> 10:43.440]  That was, thank you.\n",
      "[10:43.440 --> 10:47.680]  In downsizing, that was a point I neglected to make that I started to make.\n",
      "[10:48.400 --> 10:50.160]  Most people wait too long.\n",
      "[10:53.600 --> 10:57.360]  They wait until they are forced to move.\n",
      "[10:57.360 --> 11:01.440]  For one reason or another, they fall or this or that or the other thing.\n",
      "[11:01.760 --> 11:06.960]  I choose to make my own decisions always.\n",
      "[11:07.840 --> 11:10.960]  So when I realized that this is the best thing to do,\n",
      "[11:12.160 --> 11:14.480]  that's how I made my decision.\n",
      "[11:14.480 --> 11:17.840]  And sadly, nobody wants it.\n",
      "[11:17.840 --> 11:19.200]  Nobody wants to do it.\n",
      "[11:19.200 --> 11:21.600]  You'll hear everybody say, oh, I miss my house.\n",
      "[11:21.600 --> 11:23.680]  Everybody here will tell you how they missed.\n",
      "[11:23.680 --> 11:26.560]  They're where they lived and how they lived before.\n",
      "[11:26.560 --> 11:29.920]  No matter how wonderful the care is here and it is,\n",
      "[11:30.640 --> 11:32.640]  everybody misses what they had.\n",
      "[11:32.640 --> 11:36.320]  But I guess that's kind of human nature to miss what you no longer have.\n",
      "[11:37.600 --> 11:38.080]  However,\n",
      "[11:41.920 --> 11:47.520]  when you're forced and there are some people that have no choice in the matter,\n",
      "[11:47.520 --> 11:48.880]  they waited too long.\n",
      "[11:48.880 --> 11:51.280]  They no longer can do anything for themselves.\n",
      "[11:52.000 --> 11:57.280]  And then they continue to deteriorate and have to be placed someplace.\n",
      "[11:57.280 --> 11:59.440]  That's the biggest advice I could give to somebody.\n",
      "[11:59.440 --> 12:01.200]  I've said it to many of my friends.\n",
      "[12:01.200 --> 12:02.560]  Many, many times.\n",
      "[12:02.560 --> 12:03.840]  Don't wait too long.\n",
      "[12:03.840 --> 12:06.160]  I've said it to my children already.\n",

      "[12:08.240 --> 12:09.760]  Do something about it.\n",

      "[12:26.640 --> 12:28.960]  How they support you in that move?\n",
      "[12:30.000 --> 12:31.360]  By either being hands on them.\n",
      "[12:31.360 --> 12:32.240]  I'm sorry, Charlie.\n",
      "[12:32.240 --> 12:33.680]  Can you talk about the team here?\n",
      "[12:34.960 --> 12:38.320]  And how they support you in that move and in that transition?\n",
      "[12:41.120 --> 12:44.080]  Well, wonderful Aaron, who happens to be sitting here,\n",
      "[12:44.080 --> 12:46.000]  but I would say it even as she wasn't.\n",
      "[12:46.640 --> 12:50.960]  Wonderful Aaron and my daughter had many conversations before I moved here.\n",
      "[12:51.520 --> 12:53.840]  So my daughter's name is Martina.\n",
      "[12:53.840 --> 12:56.880]  So she made sure that everybody understood\n",
      "[12:57.120 --> 13:01.760]  what I was anticipating and how I like to live.\n",
      "[13:01.760 --> 13:05.680]  And Aaron, a queast to all of those things.\n",
      "[13:05.680 --> 13:07.840]  So they just made it very easy.\n",
      "[13:07.840 --> 13:10.640]  And when I came back after respite care,\n",
      "[13:10.640 --> 13:13.760]  after I left here after that month,\n",
      "[13:13.760 --> 13:16.880]  we went on a vacation again back down to Hilton Head,\n",
      "[13:16.880 --> 13:18.320]  where I love to go.\n",
      "[13:18.320 --> 13:21.760]  And we stayed there for a month and a half.\n",
      "[13:21.760 --> 13:24.320]  And then I came back supposedly in April,\n",
      "[13:24.480 --> 13:27.200]  but I came in earlier because we came back earlier.\n",
      "[13:28.080 --> 13:31.520]  And everyone here of the staff,\n",
      "[13:31.520 --> 13:33.600]  oh Mary, you're back, you're back.\n",
      "[13:33.600 --> 13:35.440]  I just felt so good about it.\n",
      "[13:35.440 --> 13:36.480]  Oh, you're here.\n",
      "[13:36.480 --> 13:38.960]  Everybody was glad to see me, really.\n",
      "[13:38.960 --> 13:40.720]  So that was pretty nice.\n",
      "[13:41.600 --> 13:44.560]  In that regard, the welcoming and the kindness and\n",
      "[13:46.080 --> 13:49.840]  I never felt like, you made a big mistake, you jerk,\n",
      "[13:49.840 --> 13:51.200]  but I never felt that way.\n",
      "[13:52.000 --> 13:52.960]  It was always good.\n",
      "[13:54.800 --> 13:58.640]  What would you say to someone who is considering\n",
      "[13:58.640 --> 13:59.920]  moving into this community?\n",
      "[14:01.200 --> 14:04.160]  When I've said already, I mean, I have three friends\n",
      "[14:04.160 --> 14:06.400]  that I have made at my church,\n",
      "[14:08.480 --> 14:12.400]  who we've become very close friends.\n",
      "[14:12.400 --> 14:15.520]  And I bring them here as guests for lunch sometimes.\n",
      "[14:15.520 --> 14:17.920]  And we just went to one of their homes\n",
      "[14:17.920 --> 14:18.960]  for lunch the other day.\n",
      "[14:18.960 --> 14:20.640]  We've grown very close.\n",
      "[14:21.360 --> 14:23.360]  And they're all younger than me,\n",
      "[14:23.440 --> 14:28.400]  but not that much because the chronological age\n",
      "[14:28.400 --> 14:31.120]  and the age you really are are two different things.\n",
      "[14:31.760 --> 14:34.080]  So I'm in my 90s,\n",
      "[14:34.080 --> 14:36.480]  ones in their 80s, ones in their 70s.\n",
      "[14:37.600 --> 14:41.760]  And they're all very eager to see how I live here.\n",
      "[14:41.760 --> 14:45.680]  So when I moved in, and they helped me also in my decision,\n",
      "[14:45.680 --> 14:49.520]  because I was concerned about a variety of things,\n",
      "[14:49.520 --> 14:50.880]  finances, for instance.\n",
      "[14:51.440 --> 14:56.160]  And the change and giving up everything and so forth.\n",
      "[14:56.720 --> 14:59.520]  We talk a lot about it and they give their opinion.\n",
      "[14:59.520 --> 15:02.320]  And I honor those opinions because that's why I'm asking.\n",
      "[15:03.120 --> 15:05.360]  And I have talked to each one of them about.\n",
      "[15:05.360 --> 15:07.600]  And each one of them are very interested.\n",
      "[15:07.600 --> 15:09.360]  And they all, when they come here,\n",
      "[15:09.360 --> 15:10.640]  they say, this is like a mansion.\n",
      "[15:13.840 --> 15:17.760]  Which it looks like a southern mansion when you drive in here.\n",
      "[15:17.760 --> 15:18.800]  It's pretty nice.\n",
      "[15:18.800 --> 15:19.600]  It's very nice.\n",
      "[15:20.880 --> 15:23.920]  I forgot to tell you, I also like to sit on the rocking chair out there.\n",
      "[15:25.280 --> 15:29.520]  Which isn't good because I discovered this morning when I got on the scale.\n",
      "[15:29.520 --> 15:33.280]  Since I'm here five months, I put on 10 pounds.\n",
      "[15:33.280 --> 15:34.800]  Would you believe it?\n",
      "[15:34.800 --> 15:37.040]  And I'm going to do something about it as if\n",
      "[15:37.040 --> 15:39.840]  because I sit on that rocking chair too many hours.\n",
      "[15:41.120 --> 15:42.400]  It's nice to you, Arthur.\n",
      "[15:45.280 --> 15:49.040]  Is there anything else you wanted to say about your experience or the team here?\n",
      "[15:50.000 --> 15:51.280]  Let me see.\n",
      "[15:51.280 --> 15:53.760]  If there's something else I could tell you.\n",
      "[15:53.760 --> 15:56.720]  Just to encourage people, I've families, for instance,\n",
      "[15:58.720 --> 16:04.160]  I've seen families come through to do the tour like we did in the first place.\n",
      "[16:04.960 --> 16:09.520]  And I don't know what they're really looking at and not for.\n",
      "[16:09.520 --> 16:15.280]  But of all the places, my daughter Martina did a lot of research before we made this move.\n",
      "[16:15.280 --> 16:17.120]  And this place was rated very highly.\n",
      "[16:17.760 --> 16:22.880]  Just like after my accident, every place I was, she placed me was top notch.\n",
      "[16:22.880 --> 16:24.640]  I had top notch rehab service.\n",
      "[16:24.640 --> 16:28.480]  I had top notch everything ever since I had this injury.\n",
      "[16:33.360 --> 16:37.920]  When the families come through here, if I have an opportunity, I encourage them.\n",
      "[16:37.920 --> 16:42.640]  Because if you really need to find a place, this is a very good choice.\n",
      "[16:42.640 --> 16:43.520]  A very good choice.\n",
      "[16:44.400 --> 16:46.720]  I know the sunrise has other facilities.\n",
      "[16:48.560 --> 16:51.680]  I don't think any of them look as pretty as it does here.\n",
      "[16:51.680 --> 16:54.480]  I've looked at the pictures on Facebook over and over again.\n",
      "[16:54.480 --> 16:57.280]  And I don't think any of them compare to here.\n",
      "[16:57.280 --> 16:58.320]  So this is the place.\n",
      "[17:00.080 --> 17:01.760]  Does it feel like home to you now?\n",
      "[17:01.760 --> 17:03.440]  Oh yes, very definitely.\n",
      "[17:03.440 --> 17:05.520]  Yeah, I'm very contented.\n",
      "[17:05.520 --> 17:09.200]  My son calls me regularly from Rhode Island and he said,\n",
      "[17:09.200 --> 17:11.120]  Mom, are you sure you're happy there?\n",
      "[17:11.120 --> 17:12.320]  I said, I'm happy.\n",
      "[17:12.320 --> 17:16.240]  I'll take you someplace else if you want to go.\n",
      "[17:16.240 --> 17:17.520]  I said, I'm happy here.\n",
      "[17:17.520 --> 17:18.720]  Everything is fine.\n",
      "[17:19.360 --> 17:20.240]  There's nothing more.\n",
      "[17:20.240 --> 17:21.280]  I mean, after all,\n",
      "[17:22.640 --> 17:25.040]  there are compromises through life all the time.\n",
      "[17:25.040 --> 17:26.880]  Even at your tender age, Charlie,\n",
      "[17:26.880 --> 17:28.480]  there are more making compromises.\n",
      "[17:29.360 --> 17:30.960]  You have to make compromises.\n",
      "[17:30.960 --> 17:34.800]  And if you can accept the compromises, you're much happier.\n",
      "[17:34.800 --> 17:37.040]  And why stress over them?\n",
      "[17:37.040 --> 17:37.440]  You know?\n",
      "[17:38.240 --> 17:39.600]  That's how I feel.\n",
      "[17:39.600 --> 17:41.520]  So, but that's, you know, there's my son.\n",
      "[17:41.520 --> 17:42.720]  There's my daughter.\n",
      "[17:42.720 --> 17:43.760]  I have six children.\n",
      "[17:43.760 --> 17:46.240]  One of them is sadly deceased.\n",
      "[17:46.800 --> 17:48.640]  But they're all loving children.\n",
      "[17:48.640 --> 17:51.520]  And everybody wants me to be happy.\n",
      "[17:51.520 --> 17:52.400]  So I'm happy.\n",
      "[17:53.520 --> 17:55.920]  And not because they want me to, but because I am.\n",
      "[17:57.600 --> 17:59.120]  Where are all your children in the...\n",
      "[18:00.080 --> 18:02.240]  Where are they living all over the place?\n",

      "[18:06.960 --> 18:07.680]  Everybody moved.\n",
      "[18:08.240 --> 18:10.880]  Like every young person does these days,\n",
      "[18:10.880 --> 18:13.760]  they want to get away from their hometown\n",
      "[18:13.760 --> 18:16.000]  and go someplace else where there's some life.\n",
      "[18:17.120 --> 18:17.840]  Yeah, I know.\n",
      "[18:17.840 --> 18:19.520]  I can see everybody's hand going up.\n",
      "[18:22.080 --> 18:24.400]  Is it just your daughter that's in the DMV area?\n",
      "[18:25.040 --> 18:25.520]  Excuse me.\n",

      "[18:30.800 --> 18:32.320]  I still have it over here.\n",

      "[18:49.440 --> 18:52.160]  not because he has to, because mom needs something,\n",
      "[18:52.160 --> 18:53.760]  but because he wants to feed me,\n",
      "[18:53.760 --> 18:54.880]  thankfully.\n",
      "[18:55.760 --> 18:59.040]  And my daughter from California,\n",

      "[19:16.160 --> 19:18.080]  So, yes, I'm excited about that.\n",
      "[19:18.720 --> 19:20.080]  There's always something one.\n",

      "[19:25.200 --> 19:26.960]  She is so full of ideas.\n",
      "[19:26.960 --> 19:27.920]  It's unbelievable.\n",
      "[19:28.640 --> 19:30.720]  Here's another thing that I can do here.\n",
      "[19:32.080 --> 19:34.800]  I like to eat nuts every day,\n",
      "[19:34.800 --> 19:36.000]  because they're very good for you.\n",
      "[19:36.000 --> 19:40.320]  So, almonds and pecans, I roast my own nuts in the oven.\n",
      "[19:41.600 --> 19:43.040]  And it's a simple procedure.\n",
      "[19:43.040 --> 19:44.400]  You just set the oven, you put it in,\n",
